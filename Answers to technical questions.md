<b>How long did you spend on the technical test? What would you add to your solution if you had more time? If you didn't spend much time on the technical test then use this as an opportunity to explain what you would add.</b>

<br>The testing was completed in 1.30 hrs excluding the time taken to configure the laptop as my laptop didnot have any of the softwares needed to complete the task .
If I had more time I would have added the code to get the screenshots of failed scenarios and would have testes negative scenarios with respect to search bars ,also would have restructured the code
integrated the git repository with jenkins .Also I would have migrated the test suites to cucumber (due to technical issues in my laptop ,i was unabale to configure cucumber) as it would be better aligned to the scenario and step definition provided in the task and would have given  a better structure and readability to the code


<b>What do you think is the most interesting trend in test automation?</b>
Low code tools and language independent framework like robot framework which gives a platform where one can easily automate test cases just by using keywords is an interesting trend in the world of Software QA testing.Also it has an easy way of tabular test data syntax which can help with setting data parameters.This would enable faster creation of test cases without writing lengthy code and hence can reduce time and effort while increading resuability.



<b>How would you implement test automation in a legacy application? Have you ever had to do this?</b>
first we need to understand the key areas which needs attention for eg defect prone area etc, critical modules
then we can write end to end functioanl/regression test cases to cover the affected /risk area or entire application based on the time and resources
Yes I had to automate end to end regression test cases  for a legacy application  for a bank.


<b>How would you improve the customer experience of the Just Eat website?</b>

<br> 1.the postcode field can provide auto suggestions to the user as they enter the postal code

<br> 2.currently the field only allows the user to enter postcode ,it would be much better if the user can search by typing in his location,city etc
for eg street name etc or can select an area or city from a drop down or so.

<br>3.It would be better if the phone number is also provided in the serach screen for each restaurant along with other details
<br>no validation is present on the search bar of the 2nd screen after the landing screen.No user friendly message is displayed

<br>4.To view the menu user has to click and navigate to the restaruant s
